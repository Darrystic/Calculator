# Basic Calculator Program

## Description
This is a simple Python program that prompts the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /). It performs the operation and displays the result, with error handling for invalid inputs (non-numeric values) and division by zero.

Example:
- Input: `10`, `5`, `+`
- Output: `10 + 5 = 15`

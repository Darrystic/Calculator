# List Operations Program

## Description
This is a Python program that performs the following operations on a list:
- Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
- Appends the elements `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`.
- Inserts `15` at the second position (index 1).
- Extends `my_list` with another list `[50, 60, 70]`.
- Removes the last element from `my_list`.
- Sorts `my_list` in ascending order.
- Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.

**Example Output**:
After appending 10, 20, 30, 40: [10, 20, 30, 40]
After inserting 15 at second position: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
After extending with [50, 60, 70]: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
After removing the last element: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
After sorting in ascending order: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3
